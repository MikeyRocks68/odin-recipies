        <b>Description</b>
        <p>These are instructions for the clandenstine operations
            of securing and operating an third generation American 
            battle tank. 

            The M1 Abrams entered service in 1980 and currently 
            serves as the main battle tank of the United States 
            Army and formerly the Marine Corps. The export 
            version is used by the armies of Egypt, Kuwait, 
            Saudi Arabia, Australia, and Iraq. The Abrams was 
            first used in combat in the Persian Gulf War and 
            has seen combat in both the War in Afghanistan and 
            Iraq War under U.S. service, while Iraqi Abrams
            tanks have seen action in the war against ISIL 
            and have seen use by Saudi Arabia during the Yemeni
            Civil War.
